# ultrasound-imaging-project
This repository contains the code used to control the various components of the ultrasound imaging project described on my personal website. A detailed description of the project along with component characterization can be found in the attached project final report. The Arduino code was used to control the ultrasonic sensor and write the collected data to the serial monitor. The python code was used to read the serial monitor data, process that data into the appropriate 2D array format, and create a 2D grayscale pixel plot image. The G-code was used to manipulate a 3D printer to perform the desired single-pixel scanning method. Finally, the JavaScript code was used to facilitate writing the G-code.
